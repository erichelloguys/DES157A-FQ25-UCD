        <h2>Design Template One: Conveyor Belt</h2>
        <img src="images/everypicture_design-01.png" alt="everypicture_designOne" width="1218" height="768">
        <h3>Conceptual Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Template One is very simple. The idea is to roll the gallery of images across the screen like a conveyor belt either vertically and horizontally and as they approach the edge of the screen, I would use an observer or an event-listener to make the images disappearing to the edge more opaque, smaller, or disappear entirely depending on the difficulty of the design.
            </p>
        <h3>Design Revisions</h3>
            <p>
                This design, although different from one previously imagined where I would have a movie theater like setting with a primary focus of a single image and one thumbnail, would require some much more advanced techniques and execution to complete.
            </p>
        <h3>Interaction Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Interactions are yet to be added but the user is expected to be able to scroll, zoom, and hover to expand if necessary.
            </p>
        <h3>Concerns & Questions</h3>
            <p>
                The key is how to fade images in and out of any area without making it look unnatural or glitching and likely would require a lot of trial and error.

        <h2>Design Template Two: Visual Effects</h2>
        <img src="images/everypicture_design-02.png" alt="everypicture_designTwo" width="1218" height="768">

        <h3>Conceptual Changes</h3>
            <p>
                No major conceptual changes compared to version one.
            </p>
        <h3>Design Revisions</h3>
            <p>
                This design enables a preview of the hover state that the image would be subjected to and its subsequent reaction to mouseover and mouseout.
            </p>
        <h3>Interaction Changes</h3>
            <p>
                The key is to make the overlay as cleanly and visible as possible for best viewing experience and possibly add a scroll overflow behavior for any of the additional instructions.
            </p>
        <h3>Concerns & Questions</h3>
            <p>
                This would mean each image would get a different assignment and a different overlay of messages. It should be coded with maximum efficiency with the innerHTML being swapped in and out.

        <h2>Design Template Three: UI/UX</h2>
        <img src="images/everypicture_design-03.png" alt="everypicture_designThree" width="1218" height="768">

        <h3>Conceptual Changes</h3>
            <p>
                No major conceptual changes compared to version two.
            </p>
        <h3>Design Revisions</h3>
            <p>
                This design enables a preview of the hover state that the image would be subjected to and its subsequent reaction to mouseover and mouseout. This design also enables a preview of left / right button or dragging the gallery left or right could also work. I also need to think about if the image should become expandable as soon as the user clicks into it or if there needs to be an extra button to zoom in & out of the image.
            </p>
        <h3>Interaction Changes</h3>
            <p>
                This version encourage the user to zoom in & out of the picture to see the dish in closer detail and contemplate the success of the recipe.
            </p>
        <h3>Concerns & Questions</h3>
            <p>
                Adding more interactive features would significantly boost the difficulty of the execution, so it is likely that I should review all previous tutorials.

        <h3>Conceptual Changes</h3>
            <p>
                Add opaque visual effects to both sides to give previews of the next recipe.
                Will add optional left/right arrow buttons in addition to mouse scroll.

        <h3>Interaction Changes</h3>
            <p>
                changed JS so that instead of using a function like forEach, it only needs to pick the first [0] and the last slides.length-1 images to clone and insert themselves before and after the second image just before the scrollbar passes max width or 0. The infinite scroll works flawlessly and seamlessly now and can be played with forever without seeing major discrepancies. expandText.textContent for instructions like "click to expand" and when expanded, it would change to "click to collapse" . Finally background-attachment: fixed; allows for the background to stay in place regardless of the dropdown and image scaling.
            </p>
