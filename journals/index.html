                The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari makes many agreeable and compelling arguments on the topic of form design and its relationship to UI/UX design. Everything done in html CSS and JavaScript are closely related with UI/UX design. Forms are an important method to evaluate user inputs and surveying; an option for input and being able to transform/convert that data into other resources is extremely powerful in today's web design. There are several things in the article “Best practices for form design” that I could agree with. Every designer was a user before they became a designer, and users understand just how long it takes for them to file documents that require a lot of repetitive information and form fields, such as taxes, applying for FAFSA, registering bank accounts and needing to pick security questions, etc. It is up to the designer to survey and think about how to most effectively utilize where, when and how to add a form field to get a response that is not only relevant but timely, such as “enter your income information” and this information stays in the field throughout the rest of the series.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first steps to designing a good form field layout is by brainstorming, writing out the prompts and potential responses. For example, survey questions should have specific parameters depending on the target audience, but the survey should never exceed a certain length that exhausts the users. The designer must first acquire a good set of questions and define their parameters, then can they work on the input fields. Having multiple steps in a form completion is also something that we see commonly today. When it's for registering an online account or even to place a restaurant order, one of the UI/UX principles is to make users feel “accomplished” and “data saved” without having to go back and redo everything, therefore minimizing mental fatigue. Some other best design practices such as preventing default values and having auto-focused input fields makes the overall flow smoother. Things such as label position, label proximity, size of input field, these should all be considered when building the HTML and CSS. Good labeling cuts that frustration significantly and putting them in an order that makes sense (such as chronological order) encourages a natural flow of information; these smaller details may seem insignificant, but in the competitive market for people's attention, every little step may lead to a user choosing this product over the other products.

                A large part of design is psychology. Such as manipulating sensitive personal information, making a call to action button. Like today, I was at the Ross department store, where they conducted donations to the boys and girls of America? The organization name didn't really matter. What mattered was that every time someone makes a donation by either rounding up or adding an extra dollar, the employee would exclaim and announce throughout the store in a quick burst of joyous tone: “Donation! Woo-hoo” as they ring the bell. Customers in the store can't help but turn to look in that direction every time, thinking about how nice it would be to be cheered upon, and not to mention by doing a seemingly insignificant thing by contributing an insignificant amount. The same can be done with input fields and design. By highlighting a button or making a button seem special, the webpage can “prompt” or “tempt” users to click away, navigate somewhere, or enter the necessary information. Such as “to show our sincerity in establishing meaningful relationships to our customers, we're committed to provide you with the newest DISCOUNTS, UPDATES. And FASHION trends.

                Some other call to action may include giving submission feedback to the user once the form is completed. Practical UI/UX designs tend to have an event listener button that saves the previous inputs and double checks with the user whenever they exit, refresh, or resubmit the form. This is a common practice in many government and banking platforms today, some most renowned/infamous ones include but are not limited to:
