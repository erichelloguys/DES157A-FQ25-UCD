                An experienced photographer would know how important visual thinking skills are, and maybe so does an experienced designer. However, the term visual thinking is so broad that it can be anything from simple things like angle, lighting, background to two-point three-point perspectives etc. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Is it about reading the details? A detailed visual design may not always be a good visual design, since each design has a different purpose. For example, for an advertisement poster, you might want it to be as loud and popped-out as possible to grab people's attention. Yet for journalism, you might want the picture to capture as many details as possible with a subject of emphasis. It really depends.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to the article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills” by Michael Gonchar a person may need to develop ten qualities to optimize their experience with visual thinking: Be Detective, Practice Regularly, Ask Open-Ended Questions, Notice Details, Build on Others’ Observations, Adapt These Questions for All Subjects, Expand Knowledge of the World, Start Conversations, Introduce New Ideas, Experiment With Other Ways to Look Closely.
            </p>

            <p>
                At first glance, these traits are basically saying that to have good visual thinking, a person must be willing to become observant by picking up details that are otherwise not noticeable at first glance, and must be willing to communicate more often with others to learn what they picked up because everyone sees things through a filtered lens and in many cases a different perspective. The key takeaway from all these photos and what makes them interesting is the intent, there is an intent and a focal point in all of these photos, and people are drawn to everyday scenarios with an unusual element in it. A strong intent or something highly unusual is often what separates a visual and an appealing visual.

            <h2>Learning Journal Two: Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>

                <p>Link to the referenced article: <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c" style="color: rgb(218, 218, 218);">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialogue Windows</a></p>

            <p>
                Why is pop-up so important? It allows the system to capture a user input/response in the most effective way possible and it prioritizes those inputs by pushing them out first and foremost to the users. In UI/UX practices, these pop-ups are sometimes known as modals, overlays, dialogs etc.
            </p>

            <p>
                Even though some users may find this annoying, as they cannot continue browsing the page without giving some kind of input first, maybe some information is essential to the website running properly and not returning a NULL instead. For example, what if the modal is for something like the madlibs game? There is no game and no narrative without the user entering the words first. What if they want to access some security features but are required to login first? Some things are not accessible to anyone, only registered users. Maybe it's necessary for the designer to make these modals as annoying and persistent as possible. Or maybe there is a way around it with a more user-friendly design? Figuring this out may very well be the difference maker in the competitive design industry.
            </p>

            <p>
                A good modal should always give way to certain essential features including submit or cancel buttons, close button if needed, plenty of room to describe the task etc. Article “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows” describe these elements as escape hatch, descriptive title, button, sizing & location focus, user initiated.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to know modals on mobile view may need to be in a completely different arrangement compared to desktop view to optimize the already smaller space. There are many additional features and hidden elements the designer should experiment with such as ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications).

            <h2>Learning Journal One: Research Form Design</h2>

            <address>
                <p>Link to the referenced article: <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f" style="color: rgb(218, 218, 218);">Best practices for form design</a></p>
            </address>

            <p>
                The article “Best practices for form design” by Salim Ansari makes many agreeable and compelling arguments on the topic of form design and its relationship to UI/UX design. Everything done in html CSS and JavaScript are closely related with UI/UX design. Forms are an important method to evaluate user inputs and surveying; an option for input and being able to transform/convert that data into other resources is extremely powerful in today's web design. There are several things in the article “Best practices for form design” that I could agree with. Every designer was a user before they became a designer, and users understand just how long it takes for them to file documents that require a lot of repetitive information and form fields, such as taxes, applying for FAFSA, registering bank accounts and needing to pick security questions, etc. It is up to the designer to survey and think about how to most effectively utilize where, when and how to add a form field to get a response that is not only relevant but timely, such as “enter your income information” and this information stays in the field throughout the rest of the series.
            </p>

            <p>
                The first steps to designing a good form field layout is by brainstorming, writing out the prompts and potential responses. For example, survey questions should have specific parameters depending on the target audience, but the survey should never exceed a certain length that exhausts the users. The designer must first acquire a good set of questions and define their parameters, then can they work on the input fields. Having multiple steps in a form completion is also something that we see commonly today. When it's for registering an online account or even to place a restaurant order, one of the UI/UX principles is to make users feel “accomplished” and “data saved” without having to go back and redo everything, therefore minimizing mental fatigue. Some other best design practices such as preventing default values and having auto-focused input fields makes the overall flow smoother. Things such as label position, label proximity, size of input field, these should all be considered when building the HTML and CSS. Good labeling cuts that frustration significantly and putting them in an order that makes sense (such as chronological order) encourages a natural flow of information; these smaller details may seem insignificant, but in the competitive market for people's attention, every little step may lead to a user choosing this product over the other products.
            </p>

            <P>
                A large part of design is psychology. Such as manipulating sensitive personal information, making a call to action button. Like today, I was at the Ross department store, where they conducted donations to the boys and girls of America? The organization name didn't really matter. What mattered was that every time someone makes a donation by either rounding up or adding an extra dollar, the employee would exclaim and announce throughout the store in a quick burst of joyous tone: “Donation! Woo-hoo” as they ring the bell. Customers in the store can't help but turn to look in that direction every time, thinking about how nice it would be to be cheered upon, and not to mention by doing a seemingly insignificant thing by contributing an insignificant amount. The same can be done with input fields and design. By highlighting a button or making a button seem special, the webpage can “prompt” or “tempt” users to click away, navigate somewhere, or enter the necessary information. Such as “to show our sincerity in establishing meaningful relationships to our customers, we're committed to provide you with the newest DISCOUNTS, UPDATES. And FASHION trends.

            </P>

            <p>
                Some other call to action may include giving submission feedback to the user once the form is completed. Practical UI/UX designs tend to have an event listener button that saves the previous inputs and double checks with the user whenever they exit, refresh, or resubmit the form. This is a common practice in many government and banking platforms today, some most renowned/infamous ones include but are not limited to:
